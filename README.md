Diverse questions generation framework (DQGF) can automatically generate diverse questions with their corre- 141 sponding equations for a given MWP.


## Data
* DiverseMath23k: data/DiverseMath23k consists of our generated data on Math23k. Specifically, DiverseMath23k-train/dev/text.json is the dataset we reported in paper. Furthermore, we give the DiverseMath23k-original.json, which is a dataset generated by DQGF but not filtered. It has 28w diverse MWP data, you can use a strong filter (like ChatGPT) to get clean them.

* DiverseMath23k: data/Unbiased_DQGF consists of our generated data on Unbiased-source.

## Equations Generator
```bash
#process data
python turnNum2Sym.py
#generate equations
python get_generate.py
#process equation file to the format in Question Generator
python process.py
```

## Filter
* In this paper, we use [MWP-bert](https://github.com/LZhenwen/MWP-BERT) as our filter.
